    <b><strong>Kabaddi:</strong></b>Kabaddi is a dynamic and exciting team sport that originated in ancient India. It involves two teams of seven players each. The game is played on a rectangular court, where the main objective is for a player, known as the “raider,” to enter the opposing team’s half, tag as many defenders as possible, and return to their own half without being tackled. Points are scored for each defender tagged, and the defending team earns points by stopping the raider.

    There are different styles of Kabaddi, including the standard style played on a rectangular court and the circle style, which is popular in rural areas and played on a circular field. The sport requires agility, strength, and strategic teamwork.
    
    Kabaddi has gained international recognition, with major tournaments like the Pro Kabaddi League (PKL) in India and the Kabaddi World Cup. It is especially popular in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Iran, and is growing in popularity worldwide.
    
    Kabaddi is not just a sport but also a part of cultural heritage in many regions, promoting physical fitness, teamwork, and strategic thinking.
