    <b><strong>Volleyboll:</strong></b>Volleyball is a dynamic team sport played by two teams of six players each, separated by a net. The objective is to score points by grounding the ball on the opponentâ€™s court. Each team is allowed up to three touches to return the ball over the net. The game is played in sets, typically best of five.

    The sport was invented in 1895 by William G. Morgan and has since become a global phenomenon. The court is 18 meters long and 9 meters wide, with a net height of 2.43 meters for men and 2.24 meters for women. The ball is lighter than a basketball and is usually made of leather or synthetic leather.
    
    Volleyball is part of the Summer Olympic Games and has various professional leagues worldwide. Key skills include serving, passing, setting, spiking, and blocking. The sport emphasizes teamwork, strategy, and athleticism, making it popular both recreationally and competitively.
